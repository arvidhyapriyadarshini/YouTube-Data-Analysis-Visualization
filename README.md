Data Science Projects

# Introduction
This project examines YouTube Trending Data to acquire insights into viewer behavior and preferences so that content creators and marketers can benefit. Several visualization techniques were used to gain a thorough understanding of the dataset and present key insights. Through an interactive dashboard, the project aims to make data more accessible to users.

A range of visualization techniques were utilized. These included Bar graphs, line plots, sunburst charts, TreeMap, Donut Chart, Word Clouds, Box Plots, Violin Plots, Cartogram Maps (Geo Maps), Kernel Density Estimation(KDE, with Bandwidth calculation), Histograms(Bin size calculation) in subplots, Histogram 2D Contour plot, Scatter plots, 3D Scatter plots, Density Heat Map, Hypothesis Testing, p-value, and t-test calculations, Pearson Correlation, K-Means Clustering, and Linear Regression. By employing these techniques, the project was able to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and present key insights in an easily understandable manner.

# The Dataset

The dataset used for the project is the YouTube Trending Dataset, available on the Kaggle platform. It is a comprehensive list of the most popular videos from various countries and years, updated frequently. This project focuses on data of top channels in each category based on views count, from the years 2021 and 2022, specifically for the countries of India and the USA, due to their substantial user base, with India having the highest number of YouTube users, followed by the USA.

# Technologies Used

For this project, various data visualization and analysis technologies, including Python - DASH, Plotly, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, JupyterDash, Dash Bootstrap Components, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Dash Cytoscape, and NetworkX are used. Plotly was preferred for its interactive features, allowing users to filter categorical data and gain a better understanding of the chart. NetworkX and Cytoscape were used for creating clear and precise visualizations of graphs and networks with interactive features. Pandas and Numpy were used for data manipulation and analysis, while Scikit-learn and SciPy provided tools for clustering, regression, and statistical tests and models. The filters based on country, category, and year data were provided in the plots for users to observe trends for specific countries, categories, and years. Overall, these libraries enabled us to analyze and visualize the data, identify patterns and trends, and create interactive dashboards and web applications.

# Discussions

The analysis revealed many interesting insights regarding YouTube videos. It was found that the US - Music and Indian - Comedy categories were the most liked categories. A popular myth among YouTubers is that more tags lead to more views; however, the data analysis showed that there is no positive correlation between the views and tag count. Moreover, a strong positive correlation was observed between views, likes, and comments. The analysis also revealed an overall YouTube trend, indicating fewer trending videos on channels in 2022 than in 2021. This trend could be attributed to the world moving away from the pandemic, the rise of TikTok, and changes in the YouTube algorithm. The best day and time to post videos were also identified through the analysis, which showed that entertainment videos appearing on the trending list were primarily posted on Saturdays, and posting them in the evening resulted in a significant increase in views. Lastly, the most used tag in India was 'Short,' indicating the rising dominance of short videos on the platform.

# Conclusion & Future Plans

YouTube Trending Data is a valuable resource for content creators, marketers, and researchers to understand the viewing habits and preferences of users. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, presents key insights that could be useful to YouTube Content Creators and Advertisers, and make the data more accessible and easier to understand by implementing various visualization techniques and building an interactive Dashboard.

To further improve our analysis, we could expand our dataset by adding more countries' data and analyzing viewing patterns in each country. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of YouTube's global trends and potentially reveal interesting insights about audience behavior in different regions. Additionally, incorporating subscriber counts for each channel would allow us to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) using engagement scores. This would give us another dimension for analyzing channel performance beyond just views, likes, and comments. By measuring the level of engagement, a channel has with its subscribers, we can better understand its overall impact and effectiveness in reaching its intended audience.

I had the opportunity to demonstrate my proficiency in data visualization techniques through this project as part of my graduate course. I am pleased to share that the project was highly successful and received outstanding recognition.
